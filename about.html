                    Hi! My name is Serina. I live in California and I go to UCSD!
                    My dog's name is Clyde. He's part poodle, part Labrador, and
                    I've had him ever since I was in first grade.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At UCSD, I'm sort of undeclared, but I just got accepted into the 
                    Math & Computer Science major, so I might be doing that! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I graduated from BASIS Independent Silicon Valley with high honors in 2019. 
                    From there, I decided to go to UCSD.

                </p>

                <h1> What is my perfect crime? </h1>
                <p> I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? 
                    No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. 
                    She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. 
                    In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. 
                    I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. 
                    Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. 
                    I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. 
                    I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. 
                    She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. 
                    That's where I stashed the chandelier.
