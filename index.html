<!--  What is my perfect crime? </h1>
        <section> I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? 
            No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. 
            She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. 
            In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. 
            I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. 
            Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. 
            I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. 
            I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. 
            She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. 
            That's where I stashed the chandelier. -->
